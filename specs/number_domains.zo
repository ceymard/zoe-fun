  Ints or floats could have domains, which would make things somewhat clearer
  to prevent "panics" on out of bounds access and division by 0.

  If an Int can be 0, the compiler must prevent a division by this integer where 0 is unchecked.
  If an Int is "unchecked".

  Also, floats can be non-zero.

  Or just handle NaN ?
